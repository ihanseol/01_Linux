`Twas brillig, and the slithy sarlaccs
Did gyre and gimble in the Great Pit:
All mimsy were the midichlorians,
And the womp rats outgrabe.

"Beware Jar-Jar Binks, my son!
The jaws that yap, the toungue that swipes!
Beware the Mynock bird, and shun
The frumious Rancor!"

He took his lightsaber in hand:
Long time the manxome foe he sought --
So rested he by the Gnarltree,
And stood awhile in thought.

And, as in uffish thought he stood,
Jar-Jar Binks, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!

One, two! One, two! And through and through
The lightsaber went VVVVVrrrrrooo!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.

"And, has thou slain Jar-Jar Binks?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
He chortled in his joy.

`Twas brillig, and the slithy sarlaccs
Did gyre and gimble in the Great Pit;
All mimsy were the midichlorians,
And the womp rats outgrabe.
